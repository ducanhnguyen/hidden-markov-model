### Train HMM (forward-backward algorithm)

Problem: Given a sequence of discrete observations, train a HMM

Link tutorial: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf">HMM (standford)</a>

I just implemented this tutorial without any further optimizations.

In order to check the correctness of HMM, I use the following tests.

<b>Test 0: we observe a sequence of 'H' and 'T' interchangeably. </b>
  
sequence = "THTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTHTH"

<b> Test 1: we only observe a sequence of tails. </b>

<b> Test 2: we only observe a sequence of heads. </b>

sequence = "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

<b> Test 3: we observe a sequence of heads first, followed by a sequence of tails. </b>

sequence = "TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
